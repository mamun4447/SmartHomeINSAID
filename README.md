# Can you describe the process you followed to design and develop the website for the
fictional small business?
=> First of all I did google search to see some examples websites design for fictional design, I did not copy any design, I was just trying to see minimum how many section do I need and what will be the content of those sections.

# What programming languages and technologies did you use to build the website?
=> I have used javascript library ReactJs as and for designing I have used CSS framework Tailwind CSS, and component DaisyUI. I have also used, React Icon, React Router DOM, React Hot Toast, Lottie files, and EmailJs for sending email to Admin.

# How did you ensure that the website was responsive and mobile-friendly?
=> To check responsiveness I have used google chrome Toggle Device Toolbar.

# Did you face any challenges during the development process, and if so, how did you
address them?
=> As you can see in my resume I have built all ready some projects, This project was easier than that, that's why I didn't face any major problem.

website look and function correctly on different devices and screen sizes?
